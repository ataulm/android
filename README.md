gmail-like checkable view animation
===================================

#### Aim
_e.g. wanted to try to create a completely virtual view hierarchy, so there's nothing really there on screen but an accessibility service like TalkBack could navigate it and a user proficient with TalkBack could use the app_

#### Current state (inc. next steps if applicable)

- got a swivel
- need fast out, slow in interpolator, but split in two because there's two animations that make up the swivel.
