## [ArrayLeftRotation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation/problem)

- Given a 1-dimensional array of size N, rotate the array K times.
- A single rotation shifts each element one index to the left, with the first element becoming the last element.

Did this simply:

- created a function that does one rotation
- used that function K times

There will be a function to map oldIndex -> newIndex, such that for-loops aren't needed, and only one more array needs to be initialized.
