TMDb app with Arch Components
=============================

#### Aim
Fetch a list of movies from the "top rated" endpoint of the TMDb API and display the title, description and the poster in a listview.

Process:

- [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) to see the response of the API call
- saved example response as `get_movie_top_rated.json`
- the response includes a list of results. each result includes an id (integer), title, overview and poster path.
- poster path is like: `"/yE5d3BUhE8hCnkMUJOo1QDoOGNz.jpg"` so we need to combine it with some base url.
- need more from [configuration](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/configuration/get-api-configuration) to get full image url.
- saved example response as `get_configuration.json`
- will immediately jump to [retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make API calls: well known, comfortable with integrating.

- created a stub api that returns a list of 3 forrest gumps. who's responsible for switching to a background thread? need to step back and think about the bigger pieces.
- the term "repository" is used as an abstraction over the data layer from the [archguide](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html#fetching_data)
- it exposes LiveData wrappers so we can operate along that line, using our stub data, and then fill in the blanks later. LiveData doesn't switch to a bg thread, but it does provide an async opportunity.

- let's do the UI, then we can return to the data layer.
- instantiated the repository in the activity. would usually keep this/instantiate it at a higher level like the application (either on app launch, or as-needed with something like Dagger), since it'll likely contain something that accesses the DB, which for sqlite we should keep a singleton to prevent concurrent modifications/loading DB multiple times in memory.

- next should return to the data layer, and hit the real API and mapping the response to a class. Since Retrofit already has bindings for GSON and has an RX api, which I'm most familiar with for off-main-thread work, I'll continue with that.
- **(I'm at the 2/3 hour mark now c75a07d)** but will continue.

- added Retrofit implementation of the TMDb API. This meant adding the rxjava adapter and gson converter (to convert the JSON to the api models). Decided to adjust the field names of the kotlin data classes to match the json field names, instead of annotating for brevity, though now wondering if it's possible to annotate the constructor parameters?
- next I want to pull the API key out into a properties file. I'll use novoda's gradle build properties plugin for that.

- pulled out the properties file and added it to the gitignore.
- updated proguard to allow release builds ðŸ™ˆ
- calling it here (~4/5 hours 5252b4f), anything further is just me exploring archcomp library

Building the app:

- create `<project_root>/tmdb.properties` with `apiKey=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE`
- `./gradlew clean build`
