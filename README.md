Playing with the [dog.ceo API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/). Let's make a simple app with
two screens:

- show a list of breed and sub-breeds
- clicking on a breed/sub-breed should open a detail screen with images

Let's remember to use 3rd party libraries where appropriate, no point reinventing the wheel, and of
course, let's remember to write as many tests as are necessary.
