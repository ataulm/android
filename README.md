#### Aim

Understand how (/whether) ViewCompat will preserve an existing accessibility delegate when:

- setting another
- adding accessibility actions with the addAccessibilityAction API
- marking a view as a heading

#### Current state (inc. next steps if applicable)
_e.g. completed - see blahblah.kt for main bits._
